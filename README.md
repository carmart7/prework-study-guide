# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This poject is built to get practice with the various topics that will be covered going into the first day of class.
This project contains notes abot each topic to help remember any key pieces of information.
This solves the problem of needing to go back throughot the entire prework out to get information, instead any important information can be found in this study guide webpage.
I learned how to make a simple webpage with some javascript using html, css, javascript, and git.
